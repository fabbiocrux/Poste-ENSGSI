Xue F., Robin G., Boudaoud H., Cruz Sanchez F.A., Daya E.M.;Article;Materiau / Procédé / Application;General Methodology to Investigate the Effect of Process Parameters on the Vibration Properties of Structures Produced by Additive Manufacturing Using Fused Filament Fabrication;2022;Advances in fused filament fabrication (FFF) enable the manufacturing of multi-material and multi-functional structures, which provides new opportunities for the development of lightweight and high damping structures for vibration control. However, very few studies mention the vibration characteristics of FFF printed structures. This paper proposes a general methodology to investigate the effect of process parameters, such as raster angle, nozzle temperature, layer height, and deposition speed, on the vibration properties of FFF printed structures. An application of this methodology to structures printed by polylactic acid (PLA) is realized. In terms of vibration properties, a good reproducibility of the FFF process and the vibration test was achieved. It was found that raster angle significantly affects both resonant frequency (16.6%) and loss factor (7.5%). The impact of the other three parameters is relatively low (less than 4%). All these results provide guidance for further application of FFF in the vibration field. © 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.;
Santander P., Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Camargo M.;Article;Filière / Réseau;Social, political, and technological dimensions of the sustainability evaluation of a recycling network. A literature review;2022;The development and implementation of recycling networks seems to be a promising way to cope with and mitigate the environmental problems of waste. As a mandatory condition, recycling networks must guarantee the achievement of sustainability requirements. Since the first proposal of the TBL (Triple Bottom Line) in the early 1990s, some authors have suggested that this model should be extended to include more dimensions. Recent studies have proposed that for a system to be sustainable, it should not only include the economic, environmental, and social dimensions but must also consider technological and political aspects and their subsequent sustainability indicators for their evaluation. In regard to recycling networks, however, social, technological, and political dimensions are still to be formalized to facilitate their use when designing recycling networks or evaluating their impact. In order to understand how these social, political, and technological dimensions should be integrated into the sustainability evaluation process of a potential recycling network, a systematic literature review has been conducted. A total of 160 journal articles were selected and analyzed. Information was identified on the problem addressed, the recycling domain, the methodologies used, and the social, technological, and political aspects under consideration. A set of social, political, and technological indicators to be considered for the main recycling network problems (design and planning, decision-making and performance evaluation, provider selection, price, and coordination) is then proposed. The main contribution of this work lies in the understanding for future research of how to consider social, political, and technological aspects taking into account the most common problems addressed in a recycling network. At the same time, findings and research gaps have been derived from these results. This study provides a basis for future work oriented toward the holistic evaluation of sustainable recycling networks. © 2022 The Authors;"Closed loop supply chain; Political dimension; Recycling; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chain; Social dimension; Sustainability indicators; Technological dimension"

Alexandre A., Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Camargo M., Pearce J.M.;Article;Materiau / Procédé / Application;Mechanical Properties of Direct Waste Printing of Polylactic Acid with Universal Pellets Extruder: Comparison to Fused Filament Fabrication on Open-Source Desktop Three-Dimensional Printers;2020;"Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most common and widespread additive manufacturing (AM) technique, but it requires the formation of filament. Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: Commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 /kg compared with more than 20 /kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling. © Alexandre et al. 2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2020.";"Distributed recycling; Fused granular fabrication; Polylactic acid; Recycling; Tensile properties"
Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Camargo M., Pearce J.M.;Article;Filière / Réseau;Plastic recycling in additive manufacturing: A systematic literature review and opportunities for the circular economy;2020;The rapid technical evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) enables a new path to a circular economy using distributed recycling and production. This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy. © 2020 The Authors;"3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Circular economy; Distributed recycling; Plastic recycling"

These innovation laboratories are becoming key spaces for the development of innovation competences. In this article, we describe the experiences of developing a pilot project on distributed recycling approach. The results showed how the development of this project can play a role in strategy development at the innovation laboratory level. These insights are pertinent for the managers of these spaces to identify competencies to develop in the middle/long term.

Santander P., Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Camargo M.;Article;Filière / Réseau;Closed loop supply chain network for local and distributed plastic recycling for 3D printing: a MILP-based optimization approach;2020;Recent research and initiatives increasingly propose a new approach, based on distributed plastic recycling for open-source (OS) 3D printing technologies, as a way to deal with the issue of plastic waste and to support the development of the circular economy (CE). Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of “smart grid”, composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;"3D printing; Circular economy; Closed loop supply chain; Distributed recycling; Mixed integer linear programming; Plastic recycling"
Albuquerque R., Arbelaez G., Cruz F., Camargo M., Joseph D., Tran N.;Conference Paper;Materiau / Procédé / Application;Modelling, Printing and Validation of Dental Dry Models for Implantology Skills Training;2018;The acquisition of procedural technical skills is essential to become a surgeon. Traditional medical training required to practice procedures in cadavers and animals. New technologies such as virtual reality and additive manufacturing can help surgeons to learn and improve their skills through physical models of the human organ to be intervened. However, shape representation is not enough to have a realistic training experience. Training models need to biomimicry the real organs in other types of properties such as texture, density, mechanical behaviour among other properties. Therefore, different 3D-processes materials, textures and densities need to be explored and tested. The goal of this work was the development and validation of a dental dry model system using additive manufacturing. The mechanical profile of the printed models by capturing the force applied by a dental micro motor attached to a CNC machine during a standardized drilling test is measured. This research work was done in collaboration with the Nancy School of Surgery to help develop a new system to guide the training process for dentistry surgical procedures. © 2018 IEEE.;"3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; Dry Model; Surgical training"
Pavlo S., Fabio C., Hakim B., Mauricio C.;Conference Paper;Filière / Réseau;3D-Printing Based Distributed Plastic Recycling: A Conceptual Model for Closed-Loop Supply Chain Design;2018;Plastic use and disposal is a major issue that still to be solved on the perspective of a more sustainable development of human activities. Circular economy has been proposed as a potential solution by using materials and energy through multiple phases in a recycling flow. However, most of the studies present in the literature of plastic recycling and other wastes are mainly focused on large centralized networks that try to efficiently carry their costs and / or income. In addition, particularly the centralized plastic recycling networks should face the challenge of collection and transportation for high volume and low weight polymers, affecting its economic feasibility. The emergence and development of Open-source technologies such as 3D printing extrusion and other devices provide an opportunity to explore distributed recycling as an alternative option. Under this distributed model, users will collect domestic plastic waste themselves, which can be recycled at their nearest recycling points, such as FabLabs, in order to produce 3D plastic filament and thus contribute to the Circular Economy by reducing the plastic waste. On despite its attractiveness, the complexity of this distributed approach represents a limit to this application. Moreover, the environmental and economical effectiveness still needs to be demonstrated. In this article, a conceptual model is developed and proposed for the collection process in a Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network of local and distributed plastic recycling in order to analyze its economic and environmental feasibility. © 2018 IEEE.;"3D printer; Closed Loop Supply Chain; Plastic; Recycling"
Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Hoppe S., Camargo M.;Article;Materiau / Procédé / Application;Polymer recycling in an open-source additive manufacturing context: Mechanical issues;2017;Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"3D printing; Mechanical properties; Open source additive manufacturing; PLA; Plastic recycling; RepRap"

Cruz F., Lanza S., Boudaoud H., Hoppe S., Camargo M.;Conference Paper;Materiau / Procédé / Application;Polymer recycling and additive manufacturing in an open source context: Optimization of processes and methods;2015;Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental impacts of accumulation of polymeric waste materials. However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material's mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology. © SFF 2015.All rights reserved.;
Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Muller L., Camargo M.;Article;Materiau / Procédé / Application;Towards a standard experimental protocol for open source additive manufacturing: This paper proposes a benchmarking model for evaluating accuracy performance of 3D printers;2014;The technological development of open source three-dimensional (3D) printers is creating more affordable Additive Manufacturing (AM) machines for society in different applications. For this reason, the machines' capability should be evaluated in order to establish minimum standards of performance. This paper deals with the development, manufacture and testing of a geometrical benchmarking model (GBM) in order to evaluate the geometrical accuracy performance of open source 3D printers. The methodology is demonstrated with a case study based on fused deposition modelling (FDM). The case study positions the evaluated machine according to ANSI-ISO's International Tolerance (IT) Grades. Furthermore, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value is employed as an accuracy estimator, while Taguchi tools are employed to determine the control factors with the highest accuracy for the fabrication of the GBM. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.;"benchmarking; machine qualification; open source; 3D printing; RepRap"
