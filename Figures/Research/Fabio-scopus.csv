However, very few studies mention the vibration characteristics of FFF printed structures. This paper proposes a general methodology to investigate the effect of process parameters, such as raster angle, nozzle temperature, layer height, and deposition speed, on the vibration properties of FFF printed structures. An application of this methodology to structures printed by polylactic acid (PLA) is realized. In terms of vibration properties, a good reproducibility of the FFF process and the vibration test was achieved. It was found that raster angle significantly affects both resonant frequency (16.6%) and loss factor (7.5%). The impact of the other three parameters is relatively low (less than 4%). All these results provide guidance for further application of FFF in the vibration field. © 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",,"3D printers; Natural frequencies; Structural properties; Vibration analysis; Damping structure; General methodologies; High damping; Multi materials; Multifunctional structures; Nozzle temperature; Printed structures; Process parameters; Vibration characteristics; Vibration properties; Fabrication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123074411

As a mandatory condition, recycling networks must guarantee the achievement of sustainability requirements. Since the first proposal of the TBL (Triple Bottom Line) in the early 1990s, some authors have suggested that this model should be extended to include more dimensions. Recent studies have proposed that for a system to be sustainable, it should not only include the economic, environmental, and social dimensions but must also consider technological and political aspects and their subsequent sustainability indicators for their evaluation. In regard to recycling networks, however, social, technological, and political dimensions are still to be formalized to facilitate their use when designing recycling networks or evaluating their impact. In order to understand how these social, political, and technological dimensions should be integrated into the sustainability evaluation process of a potential recycling network, a systematic literature review has been conducted. A total of 160 journal articles were selected and analyzed. Information was identified on the problem addressed, the recycling domain, the methodologies used, and the social, technological, and political aspects under consideration. A set of social, political, and technological indicators to be considered for the main recycling network problems (design and planning, decision-making and performance evaluation, provider selection, price, and coordination) is then proposed. The main contribution of this work lies in the understanding for future research of how to consider social, political, and technological aspects taking into account the most common problems addressed in a recycling network. At the same time, findings and research gaps have been derived from these results. This study provides a basis for future work oriented toward the holistic evaluation of sustainable recycling networks. © 2022 The Authors","Closed loop supply chain; Political dimension; Recycling; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chain; Social dimension; Sustainability indicators; Technological dimension",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122915420

Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: Commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 /kg compared with more than 20 /kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling. © Alexandre et al. 2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2020.","Distributed recycling; Fused granular fabrication; Polylactic acid; Recycling; Tensile properties","Cost reduction; Extruders; Fabrication; Large scale systems; Mechanical properties; Pelletizing; Plastic recycling; Polyesters; Printing presses; Economic viability; Melt solidification; Plastic materials; Recycled plastics; Reproducibilities; Statistical differences; Technical quality; Threedimensional (3-d); 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089810706

This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy. © 2020 The Authors","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Circular economy; Distributed recycling; Plastic recycling","Additives; Environmental impact; Plastic recycling; 3D printing process; Additive manufacturing technology; Economic viability; Mechanical recycling; Potential researches; Systematic literature review; Technical evolution; Technical potential; 3D printers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083723147

Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of “smart grid”, composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Circular economy; Closed loop supply chain; Distributed recycling; Mixed integer linear programming; Plastic recycling","3D printers; Integer programming; Open source software; Plastic filaments; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; 3-D printing; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Economic and environmental benefits; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Plastic recycling; environmental economics; feasibility study; linear programing; logistics; optimization; plastic waste; recycling; supply chain management; article; economic aspect; feasibility study; France; high school; plastic waste; recycling; sensitivity analysis; system analysis; three dimensional printing; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075796783

However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material's mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology. © SFF 2015.All rights reserved.",,"Additives; Environmental impact; High density polyethylenes; Open systems; Plastic recycling; Printing presses; Degradation of the material; High density polyethylene(HDPE); Multiple extrusion; Polymer recycling; Quality of product; Recycled materials; Rheological property; Technical requirement; 3D printers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084922347

In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock.

Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used.

Furthermore, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value is employed as an accuracy estimator, while Taguchi tools are employed to determine the control factors with the highest accuracy for the fabrication of the GBM. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","benchmarking; machine qualification; open source 3-dimensional printing; RepRap","3D printers; Manufacture; Printing presses; 3-dimensional printing; Additive Manufacturing; Experimental protocols; Fused deposition modelling; Geometrical accuracy; RepRap; Root-mean square deviation; Technological development; Benchmarking; Manufacture; Printers; Printing; Printing Machines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905637675
